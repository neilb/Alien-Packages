NAME
    Alien::Packages - Find information of installed packages

SYNOPSIS
        my $ap = Alien::Packages->new();

        my @packages = $ap->list_packages();
        foreach my $pkg (@packages)
        {
            print "$pkg->[0] version $pkg->[1]: $pkg->[2]\n";
        }

        my %perl_owners = $ap->list_fileowners( File::Spec->rel2abs( $^X ) );
        while( my ($fn, $pkg) = each( %perl_owners ) )
        {
            print "$fn is provided by ", join( ", ", @$pkg ), "\n";
        }

SUBROUTINES/METHODS
  new
    Instantiates new Alien::Packages object. Attributes can be specified for
    used finder (of type Module::Pluggable::Object). Additionally,

    `only_loaded'
        Use only plugins which are still loaded.

    can be specified with a true value. This forces to grep `%INC' instead
    of using Module::Pluggable.

  list_packages
    Lists the installed packages on the system (if the caller has the
    permission to do).

    Results in a list of array references, whereby each item contains:

      [ type, name, version, summary ]

    `type' is the packager type, e.g. *rpm*, *lpp* or *pkgsrc*.

  list_fileowners
    Provides an association between files on the system and the package
    which reference it (has presumably installed it).

    Returns a hash with the files names as key and a list of referencing
    package names as value.
