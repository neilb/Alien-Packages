NAME
    Alien::Packages - Find information of installed packages

SYNOPSIS
        my $ap = Alien::Packages->new();

        my @packages = $ap->list_packages();
        foreach my $pkg (@packages)
        {
            print "$pkg->[0] version $pkg->[1]: $pkg->[2]\n";
        }

        my %perl_owners = $ap->list_fileowners( File::Spec->rel2abs( $^X ) );
        while( my ($fn, $pkg) = each( %perl_owners ) )
        {
            print "$fn is provided by ", join( ", ", @$pkg ), "\n";
        }

SUBROUTINES/METHODS
  new
    Instantiates new Alien::Packages object. Attributes can be specified for
    used finder (of type Module::Pluggable::Object). Additionally,

    `only_loaded'
        Use only plugins which are still loaded.

    can be specified with a true value. This forces to grep `%INC' instead
    of using Module::Pluggable.

  list_packages
    Lists the installed packages on the system (if the caller has the
    permission to do).

    Results in a list of array references, whereby each item contains:

      {
          PkgType => $pkg_type, # e.g. 'dpkg', 'pkgsrc', ...
          Package => $pkg_name,
          Version => $version,
          Summary => $summary,
      }

    `type' is the packager type, e.g. *rpm*, *lpp* or *pkgsrc*.

  list_fileowners
    Provides an association between files on the system and the package
    which reference it (has presumably installed it).

    Returns a hash with the files names as key and a list of referencing
    package names as value:

      '/absolute/path/to/file' =>
          [
              {
                  PkgType => $pkg_type,
                  Package => $pkg_name,
              }
          ],
      ...

GETTING HELP
    To get novice help, it's usually recommended to ask on typical platforms
    like PerlMonks. To help you make the best use of the PerlMonks platform,
    and any other lists or forums you may use, I strongly recommend that you
    read "How To Ask Questions The Smart Way" by Eric Raymond:
    http://www.catb.org/~esr/faqs/smart-questions.html.

    If you really asks a question what noone can answer, please drop me a
    note with the question URL to either my CPAN address or on
    `irc.perl.org' in the channels `#toolchain' or `#devops'. I'll try to
    answer as best as I can (and as soon, as possible, of course).

  Where can I go for help with a concrete version?
    Bugs and feature requests are accepted against the latest version only.
    To get patches for earlier versions, you need to get an agreement with a
    developer of your choice - who may or not report the issue and a
    suggested fix upstream (depends on the license you have chosen).

  Business support and maintenance
    For business support you can contact Jens via his CPAN email address
    rehsackATcpan.org. Please keep in mind that business support is neither
    available for free nor are you eligible to receive any support based on
    the license distributed with this package.

    tests and patches. Further, you can submit documentation and links to
    resources to improve or add packaging systems or grant remote access to
    machines with insufficient supported packaging tools.
