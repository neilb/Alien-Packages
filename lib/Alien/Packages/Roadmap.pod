=head1 NAME

Alien::Packages::Roadmap - high level to do list and targetted goals

=head1 SYNOPSIS

This page provides a high level overview about the future extensions of
the Alien::Packages module and the improvements of the module itself.

=head1 EXTENSIONS

=head2 More Targets

Alien::Packages needs support for a wider range of platforms and packages,
this covers Gentoo Linux or HP-UX as well as identifying installed Perl5
modules using L<CPAN> or L<CPANPLUS>.

=head2 More Information

Where feasible, additional information like installed patches (e.g. AIX),
package vulnerabilities (pkgsrc), installation dates, package origin etc.,
can and should be provided.

=head2 Better API

The interface of the getters should change from an array list to a list
of hashes with appropriate keys for each package.

=head1 RESOURCES AND CONTRIBUTIONS

There're several ways how you can help to support future development: You can
hire the author to implement the features you require at most (this also
defines priorities), you can negotiate a support and maintenance contract
with the company of the author and you can provide tests and patches. Further,
you can submit documentation and links to resources to improve or add
packaging systems or grant remote access to machines with insufficient
supported packaging tools.
